** Info tags prediction
Model is trained offline and persisted. The persisted model should be placed
under =./data/models/= to be loaded by the Web service.

** TODOs
 - [X] Language identification model for info text
 - [X] Text-based info tags prediction model 
  - [X] LinearSVC
  - [X] Gradient Boosting
  - [X] BERT (bert-tiny now)
  - [ ] separate models for en and cn
  - [X] retrieve all new infos
  - [X] filter minority tags
  - [X] text augmentation and oversampling
  - [ ] try different classifier layer when there's more data
  - [ ] search more suitable data for training
  - [ ] Graph-based info tags prediction model 
  - [x] Try different sampling methods
  - [ ] stacking ensemble models by using concate title, text, author, and other metadata as features https://github.com/malteos/pytorch-bert-document-classification
  - [ ] new preprocessing with tf-idf
 - [X] Migrate to GCloud run
 - [ ] limit length of text on frontend
 - [X] accept url to predict with extraction
