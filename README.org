 - [ ] Text-based info tags prediction model 
    - [X] LinearSVC
    - [X] Bayesian model
    - [ ] Vanilla neural network
    - [ ] BERT
    - [ ] Stacking models with other feature like title, author, host, etc.
 - [ ] Graph-based info tags prediction model 
 - [ ] Try different sampling methods
 - [ ] Migrate to GCloud run
